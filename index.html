      A croissant is a flaky, buttery, crescent-shaped pastry made from a
      layered, yeast-leavened dough. While often associated with France, its
      origins can be traced to Austria. The dough is prepared using a technique
      called laminating, where butter is repeatedly folded into the dough,
      creating the signature airy, layered texture when baked.
